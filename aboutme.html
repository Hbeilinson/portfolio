    <h1>Hannah Beilinson: A Girl Who Codes</h1>
    <p>I am a first year Computer Science student at Haverford College. I am currently a TA for Girls Who Code, and as such I am learning to use HTML. <br /> I hope you enjoy the background color of my website, being the thing I by far put the most effort into. </p>

    <p>I have experience developing with Python and some very limited HTML experience (by which I mean, just like, basically making this page). <br> I also knew some Unity once, but those days are long past. *sighs* Anyway, I think it's about time for a photo of me! Enjoy :)</p>
